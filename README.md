# Noita Enhanced



# How to install

1. Go to Noita's properties tab in Steam and make sure you have it set to use the beta branch.
2. Your game's install folder will now have a _tools_modding_ folder in it. Open the readme file from that folder and follow its instructions. This step may become obsolete in the future.
3. Download this repository as a zip file and place the desired mods from it (for example, _random_starter_wand_) in the _mods_ folder in your game's install directory.
4. Start the game and open the pause menu. There should be a mods button you can click. 
5. In the mods menu, enable the mods you want to use.

You will have to start a new game after doing all of this in order for the game to register the mods.

## Fancy jetpack

This mod tweaks the jetpack particles to be affected by airflow. They look cooler.

## More altars

This mod adds 4 altars to the first 2 levels. They have a small chance to appear so you won't find them very often.

- Blood Altar: The Gods desire an offering of flesh.
- Stone Altar: The Gods desire an offering of stone tablets.
- Magic Altar: The Gods desire an offering of wands or magic spells.
- Corrupted Altar: ???

The wrong offering may offend the Gods.

NOTE: This mod requires the _more spells_ mod in order to work properly.

## More magical stones

This mod adds 3 new magical stones to the game and also slightly increases your chance of finding a magical stone on a pedestal.

- Emberstone: A stone imbued with the elemental power of fire.
- Rimestone: A stone imbued with the elemental power of ice.
- Angelstone: A purifying stone blessed by the Gods.

## Random starter wand

This mod basically just does what daily runs do, except for normal runs. Your wand will have a randomized low-level spell as well as semi-random stats.

## Improved first floor wands

This mod increases the variety of spells that wands on the first floor will have. It also introduces a small chance for projectile wands to have a projectile mod (such as double shot, etc).

I tried to keep this mod balanced so that the wands you find aren't too powerful. It just makes the wands a bit more interesting.

## Ice collision fix

This mod makes it easier to get unstuck when you get caught on pixels of ice. If you find yourself encased in ice somehow, you can dig upwards slowly to escape.

## Simple invincibility frames

This mod makes the player invincible for a very short time span when they take damage. You can tweak the settings in CONFIG_IFRAMES.lua, open it with Notepad++ or some other text editor.

## Improved workshop

This mod changes the logic used in the workshops for spawning items you can buy. It ensures that there will always be 2 or 3 wands you can purchase. The rest of the shop items will be spells.

## Peaceful shopping

This mod moves the angry god spawn point to the temple exit so you can buy wands in peace. He will still be pissed off and waiting for you.

## Angry god bounty

This mod makes the temple guardian drop a random perk when killed.

## Better procedural wands

This mod improves the algorithm the game uses to generate random wands found on pedestals. With this mod active, wands that are spawned without any sort of projectile spell will have one added so that you don't end up finding a useless wand that can't cast anything.

NOTE: This mod seems to not be working currently.
