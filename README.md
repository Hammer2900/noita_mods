# How to install

1. Go to Noita's properties tab in Steam and open the beta tab. Make sure you're on the noita beta branch.
2. Your game's install folder will now have a tools_modding folder in it. Open the readme file from that folder and follow its instructions.
3. Download this repository as a zip file and place the desired mods from it (for example, random_starter_wand) in the mods folder in your game's install directory.
4. Start the game and open the pause menu. There should be a mods button you can click. 
5. In the mods menu, click on mods to enable/disable them.

You will have to start a new game after doing all of this in order for the game to register the mods.

## Random starter wand

This mod basically just does what daily runs do, except for normal runs. Your wand will have a randomized low-level spell as well as semi-random stats.

## Improved first floor wands

This mod increases the variety of spells that wands on the first floor will have. It also introduces a small chance for projectile wands to have a projectile mod (such as double shot, etc).

I tried to keep this mod balanced so that the wands you find aren't too powerful. It just makes the wands a bit more interesting.

## Better procedural wands

This mod improves the algorithm the game uses to generate random wands found on pedestals. With this mod active, wands that are spawned without any sort of projectile spell will have one added so that you don't end up finding a useless wand that can't cast anything.

## Elemental power spells

This mod adds 2 new elemental spells that are just as powerful and dangerous as the lightning spell. Hooray, more exciting ways to kill yourself and ruin a perfectly good run.

- Magma Blast: A projectile that quickly explodes into a shower of magma.
- Flash Freeze: A projectile that freezes liquids nearby before exploding and freezing everything caught in the blast.

## More perks

This mod adds more perks to the game.

- Upgraded Wands: All of your wands have a random stat improved, with a 25% chance that an additional stat will be improved.
- Pheromone Blood: You bleed pheromones.
- Berserker Blood: You bleed berserkium.
- Tremor Step: The earth crumbles beneath your feet.
- Ironskin: You gain 20% physical damage reduction but become vulnerable to electricity.
- Barkskin: You gain 20% physical damage reduction but become vulnerable to fire.

You can toggle individual perks in CONFIG.lua, open it with Notepad++ or some other text editor.
