# How to install

1. Go to Noita's properties tab in steam and open the beta tab. Make sure you're on the noita mods beta branch.
2. Download this repository as a zip file and place the desired mods from it (for example, random_starter_wand) in your mods folder.
3. Start the game and open the pause menu. There should be a mods button you can click. 
4. In the mods menu, click on mods to enable/disable them.

You might have to start a new game after doing all of this.
