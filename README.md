# Noita Enhanced



# How to install

1. Go to Noita's properties tab in Steam and open the beta tab. Make sure you're on the noita beta branch.
2. Your game's install folder will now have a tools_modding folder in it. Open the readme file from that folder and follow its instructions.
3. Download this repository as a zip file and place the desired mods from it (for example, random_starter_wand) in the mods folder in your game's install directory.
4. Start the game and open the pause menu. There should be a mods button you can click. 
5. In the mods menu, click on mods to enable/disable them.

You will have to start a new game after doing all of this in order for the game to register the mods.



## Random starter wand

This mod basically just does what daily runs do, except for normal runs. Your wand will have a randomized low-level spell as well as semi-random stats.

## Improved first floor wands

This mod increases the variety of spells that wands on the first floor will have. It also introduces a small chance for projectile wands to have a projectile mod (such as double shot, etc).

I tried to keep this mod balanced so that the wands you find aren't too powerful. It just makes the wands a bit more interesting.

## Better procedural wands

This mod improves the algorithm the game uses to generate random wands found on pedestals. With this mod active, wands that are spawned without any sort of projectile spell will have one added so that you don't end up finding a useless wand that can't cast anything.

## Elemental power spells

This mod adds 2 new elemental spells that are just as powerful and dangerous as the lightning spell. Hooray, more exciting ways to kill yourself and ruin a perfectly good run.

- Magma Blast: A projectile that quickly explodes into a shower of magma.
- Flash Freeze: A projectile that freezes liquids nearby before exploding and freezing everything caught in the blast.

## More spells

This mod is where i throw all the new spells and modifiers i've made that don't fit any other category.

- Gravity Well: Your projectiles pull nearby objects and projectiles towards them.
- Repelling Field: Your projectiles repel nearby objects and projectiles.
- Petrify: A terrifying spell that turns almost everything nearby to stone.
- Chaotic Trail: Projectiles leave a trail of random materials.
- Chaotic Cloud: A strange cloud that rains random liquids.

## More perks

This mod adds more perks to the game.

- Upgraded Wands: All of your wands have one random stat improved, with a 25% chance that an additional stat will be improved.
- Pheromone Blood: You bleed pheromones and gain 40% melee damage resistance.
- Berserker Blood: You bleed a lot of berserkium and gain 40% slice damage resistance.
- Tremor Step: The earth crumbles beneath your feet.
- Ironskin: You gain 20% physical damage reduction but become vulnerable to electricity.
- Barkskin: You gain 20% physical damage reduction but become vulnerable to fire.
- Acid Transmutation: You convert nearby acid to oil.
- Lava Transmutation: You convert nearby lava to alcohol.
- Alchemical Transmutation: You purify nearby toxins and convert harmful magical liquids to safer magical liquids.
- Repelling Field: An invisible field pushes objects and projectiles away from you.
- Burning Afterimage: You leave a trail of magical flames wherever you go.
- Freezing Afterimage: You leave a trail of freezing magic wherever you go.
- Inferno: You are immune to fire, but you are constantly shrouded in flames.

You can toggle individual perks in CONFIG.lua, open it with Notepad++ or some other text editor.

## Fancy jetpack

This mod tweaks the jetpack particles to be affected by airflow. They look cooler.

## More altars

This mod adds 3 altars to the first 2 levels. They have a small chance to appear so you won't find them very often.

- Blood Altar: The Gods desire an offering of flesh.
- Stone Altar: The Gods desire an offering of stone tablets.
- Magic Altar: The Gods desire an offering of wands or magic spells.

The wrong offering may offend the Gods.

## More magical stones

This mod adds 3 new magical stones to the game and also slightly increases your chance of finding a magical stone on a pedestal.

- Emberstone: A stone imbued with the elemental power of fire.
- Rimestone: A stone imbued with the elemental power of ice.
- Angelstone: A purifying stone blessed by the Gods.

## Ice collision fix

This mod makes it easier to get unstuck when you get caught on pixels of ice. If you find yourself encased in ice somehow, you can dig upwards slowly to escape.
