# How to install

1. Go to Noita's properties tab in steam and open the beta tab. Make sure you're on the noita mods beta branch.
2. Download this repository as a zip file and place the desired mods from it (for example, random_starter_wand) in your mods folder.
3. Start the game and open the pause menu. There should be a mods button you can click. 
4. In the mods menu, click on mods to enable/disable them.

You might have to start a new game after doing all of this.

## Random starter wand

This mod basically just does what daily runs do, except for normal runs. Your wand will have a randomized low-level spell as well as semi-random stats.

## Improved first floor wands

This mod increases the variety of spells that found wands on the first floor will have. It also introduces a small chance for projectile wands to have a projectile mod (such as double shot, etc).

I tried to keep this mod balanced so that the wands you find aren't too powerful. It just makes the wands a bit more interesting.
